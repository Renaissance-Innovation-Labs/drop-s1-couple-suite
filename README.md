# COUPLE SUITE

This card game a thoughtful and engaging way to strengthen relationships by fostering open communication, empathy, and understanding between partners.

"Suite" is a clever play on words. In card games, a "suit" refers to one of the four categories of cards (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades). By changing it to "suite," you introduce a double meaning. It creates a metaphorical "suite" or space for couples to connect, much like a private hotel suite.

## Game components

It consists of 4 color coded card types:

1. Question Cards: These cards prompt introspection and sharing. They encourage partners to open up about their feelings, thoughts, and experiences. This can lead to deeper understanding and create opportunities for support and connection.
2. Action Cards: These cards motivate partners to actively demonstrate empathy and care. They can be direct responses to scenarios or standalone actions. These cards promote active listening, thoughtfulness, and the expression of appreciation.
3. Wild Cards: These introduce an element of spontaneity and choice. They allow partners to tailor the experience to their current needs or desires, making the game more flexible and personalized.
4. Scenario Cards: These cards simulate real-life situations that could lead to misunderstandings or conflicts. They give partners a safe space to discuss how they might feel or react in these situations, promoting empathy, problem-solving, and conflict resolution skills.
